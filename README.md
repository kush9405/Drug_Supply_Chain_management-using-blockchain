# Drug Supply Chain Transparency System

This project implements a **blockchain-based solution** to ensure transparency and traceability in the drug supply chain. It leverages **smart contracts** to track drug batches, manage ownership, and record supply chain events, ensuring trust and transparency.

---

## Features

- **Drug Tracking**: 
  - Create and track drug batches with details such as batch ID, name, manufacturer, creation date, and expiry date.
- **Ownership Management**: 
  - Securely transfer ownership of drug batches on the blockchain.
- **Supply Chain Events**: 
  - Record and retrieve supply chain events associated with drug batches.
- **Transparency**: 
  - View the complete history of a drug batch, including all events and ownership changes.

## Smart Contracts Overview

1. **DrugContract.sol**:
   - Manages drug batches, including creation, ownership transfer, and retrieval of drug details.
   
2. **SupplyChainContract.sol**:
   - Handles supply chain events and maintains the history of drug batches.

3. **SupplyChainTypes.sol**:
   - Defines shared data structures used across contracts.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js**: [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Truffle**: Install globally using:
   ```bash
   npm install -g truffle
   ```
3. **Ganache**: Use Ganache for a local Ethereum blockchain.
4. **MetaMask**: [Install MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension.

## Usage Instructions

### Verify Drug
- Enter a **batch ID** in the input field and click "Verify" to view drug details and supply chain history.

### Create Drug
- Use the `createDrug` function in the **DrugContract** to create a new drug batch.

### Transfer Ownership
- Use the `transferOwnership` function to transfer ownership of a drug batch.

### Add Supply Chain Event
- Use the `addSupplyChainEvent` function to record a new event for a drug batch.
